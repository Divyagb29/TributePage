        <b>Early Life and Education</b><br><br>
         Born Narendranath Dutta, into an affluent Bengali family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was one of the<br>
         eight children of Vishwanath Dutta and Bhuvaneshwari Devi. He was born on January 12, 1863,on the<br>
         occasion of Makar Sankranti. Father Vishwanath was a successful attorney with considerable influence<br>
         in society. Narendranathâ€™s mother Bhuvaneshwari was a woman endowed with a strong, God-fearing mind<br>
         who had a great impact on her son.<br>
         As a young boy, Narendranath displayed sharp intellect. His mischievous nature belied his interest<br>
         in music, both instrumental as well as vocal. He excelled in his studies as well, first at the Metropolitan<br>
         institution, and later at the Presidency College in Calcutta. By the time he graduated from the college,<br>
         he had acquired a vast knowledge of different subjects. He was active in sports, gymnastics, wrestling<br> 
         and body building. He was an avid reader and read up on almost everything under the sun. He perused the<br>
         Hindu scriptures like the Bhagvad Gita and the Upanishads on one hand, while on the other hand he studied<br>
         western philosophy, history and spirituality by David Hume, Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Herbert Spencer.<br>
